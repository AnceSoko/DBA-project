    "For your interest, I am not a big fan of triggers. They are automated actions which can be a good and a bad thing at the same time. I do believe that triggers are useful for very common, small impact things, like for example, in Bookshop Near Me database, trigger is activadet whenever specific amount of loyalty points is reached and from there a membership status must be changed for the corresponding customer. I personally prefer working with stored procedures."
