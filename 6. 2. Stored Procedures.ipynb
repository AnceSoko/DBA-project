    "An SQL stored procedure is a group of pre-compiled SQL statements (prepared SQL code) that can be reused by simply calling it whenever needed.  \n",

Stored procedures are very useful because they allow you to encapsulate (bundle) a set of SQL statements as a single unit and execute them repeatedly with different parameters, making it easy to manage and reuse the code."

    "-- Setting a delimiter in SP, when using MySQL is neccessary because the semicolon (;) is often used as a statement terminator to indicate the end of a SQL statement. However, when defining stored procedures, you may encounter situations where the default statement terminator conflicts with the semicolons used within the body of the procedure. Developers use the `DELIMITER` statement to temporarily change the statement terminator to a different character. This allows the definition of the stored procedure to contain semicolons without prematurely ending the SQL statement."
