    "The Transaction Control Language manages the changes in the data which are made by the DML operations. The alteration made by the DML commands such as UPDATE, INSERT or DELETE is not permanent and these changes can be canceled before the present session gets closed. To control the changes and processing of data, TCL is used simultaneously with the Data Manipulation Language. As we perform many operations on the data, the database might become inconsistent between the transactions."
